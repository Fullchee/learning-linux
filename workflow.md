### Calendar (Google Calendar)
Set reminders by default at the time of
* for Must Do Events that are quick and that I might forget.

### Todoist
* Something always comes up and I end up not finishing all of my To-Dos
* better than calendar, the unfinished items stay on top
** don't have to drag the items from the previous day
